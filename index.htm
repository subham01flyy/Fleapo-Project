              Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
              population with some countries and entities actively fighting
              against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
              holding the fort.

              Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
              tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with
              some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass
              adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
              down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words
              to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the
              social currency of their favourite person and watch their
              investment as is with other crypto currency project.

              We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the
              "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency,
              bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects
              to make it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for
              a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.
